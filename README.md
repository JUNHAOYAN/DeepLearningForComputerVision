# DeepLearningForComputerVision
I create this repository to utilize some classical models 
and how I used them to participate the competition or competition which is already held years ago.  
So far, it includes:
* Datasets
  * Industry Competition in GuangDong Province 
  -- Aluminum Defect Detection (round 1 (classification) and round 2 (Object Detection))
* Backbones 
  * ResNet
  * VGGNet
* Models
  * YOLO1 (making...)
